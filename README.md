# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

In this project, I built upon a cloned repo and implemented the single-page website, utilizing front-end skills such as HTML, CSS/SASS, JS, jQuery and AJAX as well as back-end skills in Node, Express and MongoDB. 

On top of the core functionalities, I also implemented extra features from two stretch acitivities: 
1. showing and hiding the input form for new tweet upon clicking "write a new tweet" on the top-right corner; 
2. utilizing SASS to structure my stylesheets in a hierarchical way by using the SASS features of variables, mixins and nesting.
